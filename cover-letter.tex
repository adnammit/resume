I love a good challenge. Over the past four years, I have developed my skills as a full-stack developer building scalable, highly available enterprise applications. Whether I'm fine-tuning responsive website components, designing new SQL relations, composing complex object-oriented hierarchies or learning entirely new languages, I am growth-driven and love picking up new skills and using code to solve problems.
\\\\
% I am as comfortable polishing up a UI interface as I am sleuthing through event logs and databases, and I find that cleaning up an old code base can be as rewarding as building a completely new feature.
In my most recent position at ConsumerCelluar, my primary tech stack focus was .NET with C\#, particularly building ASP.NET REST APIs with Vue.js and Razor for the front end, with a few opportunities to incorporate GraphQL and Docker. I designed and lead implementation on new features and applications from the ground up, and I would love the opportunity to take what I've learned and apply it to new challenges at Stack Overflow.
\\\\
In addition to my technical knowledge, my experience in the service industry has equipped me with skills critical to any organization. I self-manage my own workload while supporting the larger team effort, striving to create a positive and supportive environment. I thoroughly enjoy planning and organization and am accountable for my actions while taking pride in the craft and thoughtfulness of my work.

%REPLACE WITH SOMETHING BETTER
% My background as a craftsperson has taught me the value of quality in a competitive market. My time as a bike mechanic has shown me that I relish work that is challenging: replete with constantly evolving techniques and new systems to learn, while also fostering development and mastery of skills over time. When I worked as a barista I felt that every drink I poured was a reflection of myself -- I try to make every morsel of work my best.
I greatly appreciate your time spent reviewing my resume -- if you think my attitudes and talents could be a good fit at Stack Overflow, I would be delighted to be considered as an addition to the team!
